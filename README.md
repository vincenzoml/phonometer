   - **Noise Threshold**: Filter out background noise by setting a minimum level

## Technical Details

- Uses the Web Audio API for audio processing
- Implements proper decibel (dB) calculation using `20 * log10(amplitude)`
- Updates at 10Hz (every 100ms) for optimal performance
- Includes signal smoothing for stable readings
